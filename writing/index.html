              <small class='article-date'>December  5, 2014</small>
              <div class='article-body'>
                <p>Almost two years ago, I left my ethnic studies readings and stacks of essays on
                18th century literature in central Connecticut for the fast-paced and
                innovative tech scene in San Francisco.</p>
                
                <p>Gone are my college days of sitting in on small seminars where I discussed
                topics ranging from 19th century American economic history, to Baroque art
                symbolisms, to the problematic consequences of the social construction of race
                and other identities. My classmates and friends read Karl Marx and Judith
                Butler, taught English to non-English-speaking university staff employees,
                fought for food justice in the local community, and wrote senior essays and
                theses on topics of education, race, Brazilian music, and reproductive health
                justice.</p>
                
                <p>Those days have been replaced with client meetings in a skyscraper in downtown
                San Francisco, where we discuss how to build profitable web applications that
                people will use. I talk to my co-workers about practicing the best design
                patterns in our HTML and SASS code. I’ve picked up technical jargon regarding
                databases, DNS, CDN, continuous integration. I’ve learned about Series A
                fundings, angel investment, company valuations, and such. If I am at a coffee
                shop in San Francisco, I’ll inevitably see at least a few people sporting a
                sweatshirt branded with a startup logo, coding furiously behind their Macbooks.</p>
                
                <p>During my last two years of college, I spent my weekends learning the skills I
                needed to join the glittering San Francisco Tech Scene. I diligently researched
                what skills I needed to acquire: UI and UX design, HTML/CSS/Javascript, and
                such. I juggled my time between reading chapters on Mao’s revolution in my
                Modern China textbook to reading how to build a Ruby on Rails application.
                Sometimes, it was difficult figuring out what was my biggest priority; acing my
                midterm, or successfully implementing a jQuery function to create a cool
                animation. I knew that after college, I wanted to work on creative projects in
                an interesting city. The pipe dream was to work as a designer at a tech company
                in San Francisco.</p>
                
                <p>With engineers and designers in high demand at tech start-ups in the Bay Area,
                I was fortunate enough to find stable employment after graduation. But my
                circumstance is an anomaly; we all know how difficult it is to find a job these
                days. It’s particularly hard for recent college graduates, where our work
                experience is sometimes measured by the work experience, which we don’t always
                have a lot of because we just came out of school. Thus, people have always been
                urged to study business, engineering, or medicine to get a leg up in finding a
                job after college.</p>
                
                <p>While there was a brief stint where I considered majoring in business because
                my parents urged me too, I’m glad that I didn’t. I’m glad that I got to tap
                into my curiosity to learn about the intersections of race, gender, and class
                in the context of modern history and events. Granted, I don’t talk about
                identity formations everyday with my clients who want me to build web
                applications for them, but studying interdisciplinary disciplines taught me how
                to think critically and connect the dots. The higher-level skills I gained in
                my college education — the critical thinking skills, communication skills, and
                holistically-minded thinking — are invaluable to my work as a designer today.</p>
                
                <p>Technology is the set of tools and systems that humans have created to enhance
                their lived experiences in their environments. From the tools that
                hunter-gatherers constructed to hunt livestock, to the construction of the
                transcontinental railroad that connected one coast to the other in mid-19th
                century America, to the smartphones in all of our pockets proliferating today,
                we strive to optimize our experiences in the world. If we merely try to study
                how to create a thing without thinking of the broader landscape, we’re merely
                thinking of concepts in a vacuum without consideration of their meanings and
                consequences at large.</p>
                
                <p>Sometimes during college, my friends and I would joke about how we wouldn’t
                find a place in the “real-world” to apply our knowledge of critical race
                scholarship. While people may view humanities as irrelevant knowledge with no
                practical value, I wholeheartedly disagree. The humanities studies what makes
                humans feel more whole. To study the humanities is to learn how to serve your
                role in society. The humanities encompasses not only English and history, but
                philosophy, religion, sociology, biology, astronomy, and economics. The
                humanities is inherently interdisciplinary. I truly believe that the humanities
                teaches you how to become a better citizen. Studying the liberal arts has made
                me a more informed designer.</p>
                
                <p>If you want to work in tech, don’t hesitate to study the liberal arts if that
                is what will fuel your curiosity. You don’t need to major in engineering or
                business to enter tech.</p>
                
                <p>I love how innovative the tech scene is, but I will also say that the industry
                would benefit from greater diversity; we need more women, people of color,
                queer people, and humanities-trained thinkers. We need to get away from trying
                to solve first-world, privileged, straight-white-male problems (which sometimes
                aren’t real problems anyway), and figure out how to use technology to (attempt
                to) solve larger problems like income inequality and a broken public education
                system.</p>
                
                <p>Study the humanities if you would like. Read and write words. Discuss ideas.
                Learn how people, societies, relationships, systems, and the world work. And
                lastly, see what you could do to be apart of the bigger picture.</p>

                <p>The most frustrating thing I had with standard schooling was how belittled I often felt for being a type of student who had a lot of abstract thoughts but was unable to communicate them clearly.</p>
                
                <p>I could write on and on in my papers trying to argue my point, but they never made sense to the professor. Math didn’t make much sense to me. Science less so. And it wasn&rsquo;t like I didn&rsquo;t try hard enough. I tried. <em> Very hard.</em></p>
                
                <p>Years of schooling trains us to measure ourselves by the grades we receive, and we thus correlate these grades with intelligence. The problem with this is that it favors one kind of intelligence over over kinds.</p>
                
                <p>There is emotional intelligence. Social intelligence. Spatial intelligence. People who know a lot about playing instruments, making friends, cooking vegetarian meals, being a kind person, building an Ikea bookshelf, fixing a bicycle, climbing a mountain, making a website. One thing isn’t necessarily more impressive than another.</p>
                
                <p>As much as I want all of us to celebrate each others’ differences and victories, I also want to remind each of us to celebrate our own. </p>
                
                <p>I oftentimes overlook my little victories when out-shadowed by other people’s. However, I once heard the saying that you can’t love others if you don’t love yourself. I’m not sure how exactly, but I believe that this mantra supports my point.</p>
                
                <p>I would also like to urge for a redefinition of “success” and how we measure it. It’s not by grades, your job title, SAT scores, salary, car, or degree. For a very long time, I defined myself by these superficial markers of success… Until I got tired of it because I didn’t feel “successful.” I defined success on my own terms. </p>
                
                <p>You only live once. Do yourself a grand favor and choose to define what “success” means to you.</p>

              <h2 class='article-title'><a href="/writing/2014/writing-code-using-vim.html">Writing Code Using Vim</a></h2>
              <small class='article-date'>March  6, 2014</small>
              <div class='article-body'>
                <p>When I first interviewed for a design apprentice position at
                <a href="http://thoughtbot.com">thoughtbot</a>, I switched from Sublime Text
                2 and to join the Vim world. Why? A majority of the developers and designers use Vim as their preferred text editor, and I wanted to make a good impression during the interview. Today, Vim is what I use to code.</p>
                
                <p>The first two weeks of my relationship with Vim was frustrating; I cursed at my
                keyboard, impatient with how difficult it was to navigate the terrain under my
                fingers. Deleting a word seemed impossible. Even navigating through the text
                felt like climbing a mountain; I couldn&rsquo;t use the arrow keys on my keyboard. I
                navigated with the HJKL keys. But with a <a href="http://www.viemu.com/vi-vim-cheat-sheet.gif">Vim graphical
                cheatsheet</a> by my side, I kept
                trudging along.</p>
                
                <p>If you&rsquo;re trying out Vim, give it two weeks before deciding that it isn&rsquo;t for
                you. It has honestly made me more efficient, and therefore, happier coder! Here are some shortcut
                keys that I really enjoy:</p>
                
                <h4>Scenario #1: You want to sort the attributes alphabetically in your CSS file.</h4>
                
                <p><pre><code>
                div {
                  margin: 10px 20px;
                  border-top: 1px solid #000;
                  box-sizing: border-box;
                  padding: 20px;
                }
                </pre></code></p>
                
                <p>You want to sort the attributes alphabetically in your CSS to improve legibility and standardize your method. It&rsquo;s really easy to do this in Vim. It is as simple as this:  <code>V&lt;esc&gt;:sort</code></p>
                
                <p>It becomes:</p>
                
                <p><pre><code>
                div {
                  border-top: 1px solid #000;
                  box-sizing: border-box;
                  margin: 10px 20px;
                  padding: 20px;
                }
                </pre></code></p>
                
                <h4>Scenario #2: You want to change a words within a tag.</h4>
                <pre class="highlight html"><span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;</span>The <span class="nt">&lt;strong&gt;</span>brown<span class="nt">&lt;/strong&gt;</span> dog likes to eat dog food.<span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
                </pre>
                <p>Let&rsquo;s say the dog isn&rsquo;t brown; it is blue! Instead of going into the
                selection and clicking backspace x 5 (because I know that hurts my fingers
                if I do it all day), let&rsquo;s make it easier for ourself. Go into the selection, and&hellip;</p>
                
                <ul>
                <li>To change inner tag: <code>&lt;esc&gt;:cit</code></li>
                <li>To change inner word: <code>&lt;esc&gt;:ciw</code></li>
                <li>To delete inner word: <code>&lt;esc&gt;:diw</code></li>
                </ul>
                
                <hr>
                
                <p>If you decide to take the leap to use Vim, here are my recommendations:</p>
                
                <ul>
                <li><p><strong>Give it at least two weeks before deciding if it works for you or not.</strong>
                I&rsquo;ve talked to folks who give up after three days, deeming that the learning
                curve is too high. Of course it&rsquo;s hard to learn. And of course you will be
                very slow in the beginning. But once you go through the process of
                trial-and-error over the course of two weeks, you might find you enjoy Vim.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Practice Vim on side projects, not during your day job.</strong> At the beginning
                of your quest, you will inevitably write code much slower using Vim than with
                your usual text editor. Practice Vim on your side projects so that you don&rsquo;t
                feel the pressure to learn Vim AND perform efficiently at your job. When you
                use Vim on your side project, you can mentally focus all of your energy on
                learning Vim and take note of things you learn without any overhanging
                deadline. You&rsquo;ll learn better this way.</p></li>
                <li><p><strong>Refer to the Vim Wiki for assistance, or Google in general.</strong> If you are a
                programmer and reading this, chances are that you&rsquo;re already used to the
                workflow of Googling for whatever help you look for in your day-to-day work.
                A website I enjoyed very much is the <a href="http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Vim_Tips_Wiki">Vim section on
                Wikia</a>.</p></li>
