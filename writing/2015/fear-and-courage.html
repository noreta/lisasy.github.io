            <div class='article-body'>
              <p>In 2014, one of the things I deliberately set out to do was to confront my
              fears. To me, this meant learning how to leave my comfort zones, because I
              believe that some of the greatest and most impactful growth occurs when we are
              outside of our comfort zones. </p>
              
              <p>At a certain point in the year, a lot of the core fixtures of my life — my work
              life, home life, and personal life — demanded to be evaluated. I didn’t wake up
              one day and began to reconsider the current facts of my life. Rather, other the
              course of months, I noticed my harmonious rhythm gradually evolve into more
              frequent bursts of irritation and confusion.</p>
              
              <p>To offset these nagging feelings, I tried to change up small habits to improve
              my well-being: I began running four times a week, going to the gym, cooking
              home cooked meals more often, and studying French. I loved doing all of those
              things. And yet, those bigger fixtures in my life continued asking for my
              attention…</p>
              
              <p>I’ve come to accept that in life, there will always be some sense of
              discomfort. Nothing is perfect, and for good reason. What I was trying to gauge
              during this period was, is the discomfort I felt a natural one as part of life,
              or was it really an internal voice warning me that something was off?</p>
              
              <p>During this process, after I decided to be open the gates for changes in my
              life to occur, I saw my opportunities blossom. I was both open to new jobs, new
              people, new places.</p>
              
              <p>While uncertainty can be scary, it’s equally fruitless to attempt to <em>control</em>
              or <em>force</em> the outcome of a situation. One current example is the state of my
              current housing situation. I’m transitioning to a new apartment to live within
              the Bay Area. Anyone who lives here can attest to what a nightmare that process
              is. With the limited housing stock here and the highest cost of living, this
              experience can be frustrating. The process typically involves responding to
              fifty Craigslist postings and receiving few if any response. Beyond the fact
              that there is a housing crisis in this current climate, you also can’t help but
              take it a little personally when potentially roommates choose to not respond to
              your email. </p>
              
              <p>I&rsquo;m current jumping between friends&#39; couches and floors around town until I
              find a new place to live. I can’t control if people choose to not respond to
              me. However, what I can do is send those email solicitations out and hope for
              the best. I can&rsquo;t control the sea and the weather conditions, but what I can do
              is steer the ship in the direction I feel is best fit for me.</p>
              
              <p>What compelled me to truly open the gates in my life for radical change? When
              that discomfort was begging me much that I realized that there was nothing left
              to lose… except fear.</p>
              
              <p>It hit me that when we overcome our fears, we’re left with the courage that had
              always been there the entire time. I think that at our core, we are made up of
              a large flaming and passionate ball of courage, yet we sometimes cannot tap
              into it because of the mask of fear caging it. I appreciated the imagery evoked
              in my mind when I voiced this to myself.</p>
              
              <p>The sort of courage I got to uncover for myself is the courage to love, be
              patient, keep an open heart and an open mind. While in this process I sorted it
              a lot of tangible shifts in my life, the biggest shift was the mental one I
              underwent: discovering my own Lisa-flavored courage that was at my core.</p>
              
              <p>The courage is present in everyone. I hope that we all get the opportunities to
              tap into that courage by stripping away the fear we carry in our lives.</p>
