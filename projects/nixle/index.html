              <p class='standfirst'>In six months, I led the product, UX, interface, information architecture, and front-end development on both web and iOS platforms for <a href="http://nixle.com"target="_blank">Nixle</a>, which keeps you up-to-date with relevant information from your community.<br><br> As the lead product designer, I gained many learnings in building a web and iOS application end-to-end, from the initial product ideation all the way to implementation.</p>

                <h4>Project Background</h4>
                <p>
                  Founded in 2007, Nixle connects citizens with alerts from their government agencies such as firefighters and police officers. In an effort to expand their product to broadly connect agencies, citizens, and schools altogether, the Nixle team came to <a href="http://thoughtbot.com" target="_blank">thoughtbot</a> to pursue this vision.
                </p>
                <p>
                  As the lead product designer on this project, I worked through the
                  entire project lifecycle for the MVP launch in November 2014. I would
                  be responsible for identifying the customers' goals to prototyping to
                  building out features that shipped. Thus, it was imperative for me to
                  conduct the product discovery, grasping Nixle's existing product,
                  business, technology, and customer. I led a week-long design sprint
                  with the stakeholders, addressing how to define a product that
                  addresses customers' needs within the various constraints we had.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Our goal was to build an MVP in web and iOS platforms to provide the
                  services to the customers.

              <h4>The Customer</h4>
              <p>
                Since Nixle is currently connected to thousands of public safety agencies and citizens using their service, we aimed to define two groups of primary customers:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>School-related people (K-12 school staff & administration, parents, guardians)</li>
                <li>Neighborhood people</li>
              </ol>
              <p>
                Because <strong>school-related people</strong> represent the more
                specific target base, we determined them to be the target customers for
                the MVP. We hoped that a portion of this group would become
                <strong>"super users"</strong> who would engage deeply with Nixle and
                convert their neighbors into Nixle users. We hypothesized that strong
                engagement within schools would lead to adoption at a neighborhood
                level.

                  because they want to learn what is going on and also interact with
                  the community.

                <h4>What purpose does Nixle serve to people?</h4>
                <p>
                  As a team, we identified the core <a href="https://medium.com/the-job-to-be-done/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27" target="_blank">job</a> of this application that will benefit its customers, whom we defined as "parents, neighbors, people interested in their neighborhoods, and everyone else."
                </p>
                <p>
                  Next, we figured out the primary job of the application after defining the perceived customer goals, and how we could help accomplish them.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In order to get to the point, we did an analysis of analogous and competitive products. These were some of the few we looked at: <a href="http://nextdoor.com/" target="_blank">Nextdoor</a>, <a href="http://patch.com/" target="_blank">Patch.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.potreroview.net/" target="_blank">The Potrero View</a>, amongst others.

                  We determined the customer's goals, inhibitions holding them back
                  from completing those goals, and how Nixle could help them accomplish
                  them.

                <h4>Figuring out flow and information architecture</h4>
                <p>
                  Due to the large scope of the product across web and mobile platforms, I looked at the large picture on what type of experience to provide, and how we would get there. In considering this large scope, we were able to break up the product into these core components:
                </p>
                <ul class='col-2'>
                  <div class='column'>
                    <li>Landing/Onboarding</li>
                    <li>Authentication</li>
                    <li>Notification</li>
                    <li>Feed</li>
                  </div>
                  <div class='column'>
                    <li>Communities</li>

                </ul>
                <p>
                  Since we operated mobile-first, I figured out the flow and information architecture of the native iOS appliciation, taking into consideration native components based on the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/" target="_blank">iOS Human Interface Guidelines</a>. While broad conceptual architecture across iOS and the web remained the same, their respective platforms allowed for diverging presentations of information.

                      Using <a href="https://www.flinto.com/" target="_blank">Flinto</a>, I created a preliminary prototype of the iOS application. It features the core information architecture in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/Bars.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH12-SW52" target="_blank">tab bar</a>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One of my biggest learnings was that <strong>I should have built
                      lower-fidelity screens for this interactive prototype</strong>,
                      perhaps even possibly with pencil and paper. It was too early to
                      be thinking about visual design while we were still figuring out
                      the information architecture.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Furthermore, my teammate who is an iOS developer gave me feedback
                      that it's more ideal to test the interactive prototype in
                      low-fidelity to assess the complexity of the proposal before
                      polishing the "look & feel".

                <h4>Using card sorting to sort out uncertainties</h4>
                <p>
                  During this point in the project, I felt <i>very</i> uncertain about
                  the viability of two features: 1) "trackify" and 2) allowing users to
                  create alerts. In order to test my hypothesis that these features
                  would prove mentally challenging to new application users, I ran a <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/card-sorting" target="_blank">card sorting</a>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This exercise confirmed my hypothesis that these features would be
                  mentally complexing to new users, and I was able to defend the
                  product decision to not have these two features be in MVP with this
                  evidence.

                <h4>Front-end development with Rails, Backbone.js, SCSS, and HTML</h4>
                <p>
                  I got to work with Backbone.js on Rails for this project. While the
                  API was served through Rails, Backbone.js was used to create a
                  performant front-end experience for the user. I collaborated closely
                  with the Nixle developer, and we problem-solved often to ensure we
                  were creating the cleanest and most easily maintainable code base. I
                  wrote in HTML, SCSS, and Javascript, occasionally creating templates
                  and views in Backbone.js.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Here are some simple code snippets that emerged from this project:
                </p>
                <pre><code>&#x000A;  @mixin icon($content) {&#x000A;    &:before {&#x000A;      content: $content;&#x000A;    }&#x000A;  }&#x000A;</code></pre>
                <pre><code>&#x000A;  @mixin paragraph-ellipsis($number-of-lines: 2) {&#x000A;    -webkit-box-orient: vertical;&#x000A;    -webkit-line-clamp: $number-of-lines;&#x000A;    display: -webkit-box;&#x000A;    overflow: hidden;&#x000A;    text-overflow: ellipsis;&#x000A;  }&#x000A;</code></pre>

                  While my primary role in working on the iOS application was to direct
                  the product design and provide assets, I had occasional opportunities
                  to touch the code base in Xcode. Here are some of the things I got to

                <p>
                  In the browser using code, I got to explore different visual and
                  communication design for Neon's dashboard. As a team, we liked the
                  visual branding of the rightmost image below.

                  These iterations above were less ideal, given that the user base
                  would primarily be middle-aged woman who frequent Pinterest.

                  I found it challenging defining the visual design because I was unsure of the brand. Later into the project, their team handed me their completed branding, which pointed me in the right direction.

              <h4>Shipping</h4>
              <p>
                In six months, I got to work on shipping a web <strong>and</strong> iOS product for Nixle. It was a challenging but wonderful learning experience going from the initial ideation stage and learning about the company and product, to defining the information architecture, visual design, to creating the design assets necessary in Sketch and Illustrator, to learning about templates and views in Backbone.js on Rails, to touching front-end design in Xcode, and to doing testing and research along the way.
