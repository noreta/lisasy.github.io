# Lisa Sy's personal website
---

This is my personal website. It showcases some of my work as a product designer,
front-end developer, and artist.

Eventually, I'd like to include some of my writings. These topics interest me:

* Design
* Art
* Geography
* Urban development
* Sociology, and the intersections of race/gender/class/sexuality
* Music
