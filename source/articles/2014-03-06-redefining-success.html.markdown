The most frustrating thing I had with standard schooling was how belittled I often felt for being a type of student who had a lot of abstract thoughts but was unable to communicate them clearly.

I could write on and on in my papers trying to argue my point, but they never made sense to the professor. Math didn’t make much sense to me. Science less so. And it wasn't like I didn't try hard enough. I tried. <em> Very hard.</em>

Years of schooling trains us to measure ourselves by the grades we receive, and we thus correlate these grades with intelligence. The problem with this is that it favors one kind of intelligence over over kinds.

There is emotional intelligence. Social intelligence. Spatial intelligence. People who know a lot about playing instruments, making friends, cooking vegetarian meals, being a kind person, building an Ikea bookshelf, fixing a bicycle, climbing a mountain, making a website. One thing isn’t necessarily more impressive than another.

As much as I want all of us to celebrate each others’ differences and victories, I also want to remind each of us to celebrate our own. 

I oftentimes overlook my little victories when out-shadowed by other people’s. However, I once heard the saying that you can’t love others if you don’t love yourself. I’m not sure how exactly, but I believe that this mantra supports my point.

I would also like to urge for a redefinition of “success” and how we measure it. It’s not by grades, your job title, SAT scores, salary, car, or degree. For a very long time, I defined myself by these superficial markers of success… Until I got tired of it because I didn’t feel “successful.” I defined success on my own terms. 

You only live once. Do yourself a grand favor and choose to define what “success” means to you.
