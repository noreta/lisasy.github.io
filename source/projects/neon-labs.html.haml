        %h4 Defining the goal
        %p
          The Neon team came to <a href="http://thoughtbot.com"
          target="_blank">thoughtbot</a> to design the interface and user
          experience for uploading and selecting Neon-generated thumbnails for
          their videos. In order the understand the product, business,
          technology, and customer, I led a week-long design sprint with the
          stakeholders, addressing the customers' needs and identifying how
          Neon can fulfill them.
        %p
          While Neon came in with wireframes and mockups, we did not stay
          too fixated on those existing sources. We had to learn more about the
          product and what the customer needed before making decisions on how
          the application should function.
        %h4 The Customer
        %p
          With the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service"
          target="_blank">SaaS</a> business model, we defined our primary
          customers for MVP to be media publishers.
        %figure.image-wrapper
          = image_tag("neon_labs/neon-sprint-whiteboard.jpg")
          %figcaption
            After defining our customer (media publishers), we brainstormed the
            imagined critical user flow of the application. This is Bob's
            story.

          great user experience for those using this service?
        %p
          With a lot of post-it notes, sketching, and whiteboarding, we
          identified five (5) core situations, positioning them as <a href="https://medium.com/the-job-to-be-done/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27" target="_blank">job stories</a>.

              This is pretty neat. I don’t really have to think so much about
              this. Neon is fast.

            I want to find the best Neon-recommended thumbnails for my video 
          %h5 Motivation
          %p
            so I use Neon’s generate-and-publish-thumbnail feature to
            algorithmically find the best frames.
          %h5 Desired Outcome
          %p
            to publish the best thumbnail for my video on its live site.

              I trust Neon’s algorithm reader, especially more than my
              own subjective opinions.
            %li
              I never have to think about checking back on Neon to generate and
              publish thumbs, especially when my biggest focus is on simply
              checking analytics.
            %li
              If I’m unhappy with analytics, I can always change the video thumb
              to test and try which performs best.
            %li This is a huge timer saver for me.

              to it if I needed. It would simply just hide it, which is great
