        %h4 Fantasizing spaces
        %p
          Having grown up in the smoggy and car-ridden Los Angeles suburbs,
          I've always romanticized the San Francisco Bay as an alien planet
          with tall hills and cold weather, albeit the cities were only 400
          miles away. In 2011, I took a road trip up from LA with a few
          friends, and I instantly fell in love with the city when I observed
          two things: people wore sneakers everywhere, and gay couples could
          hold hands in public without getting a double take. I was sold.
        %h4 Establishing a home
        %p
          In order to establish a sense of community, I decided to be an active participant of the city.
          As someone who enjoyed walking around cities and who enjoyed drawing, it made sense to combine the two to create Hues & Views.

      %h4 I saw the Eiffel Tower; so what?
      %p
        When I travelled abroad by myself in April 2014 and visited the one of
        the most sought-after cities in the world, Paris, I wondered about the
        significance of visiting famous sites. After we see the thing we've
        been meaning to see, what's next? I took a few selfies with the Eiffel
        Tower and the Louvre. But yet, I still didn't have a relationship with
        this Place. I did what felt most uncomfortable to me; I tried to draw
        the moment to cement the memory with my ink lines.
