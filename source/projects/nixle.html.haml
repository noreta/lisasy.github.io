        %p
          Founded in 2007, Nixle connects citizens with alerts from their government agencies such as firefighters and police officers. In an effort to expand their product to broadly connect agencies, citizens, and schools altogether, the Nixle team came to <a href="http://thoughtbot.com" target="_blank">thoughtbot</a> to pursue this vision.
        %p
          As the lead product designer on this project, I worked through the
          entire project lifecycle for the MVP launch in November 2014. I would
          be responsible for identifying the customers' goals to prototyping to
          building out features that shipped. Thus, it was imperative for me to
          conduct the product discovery, grasping Nixle's existing product,
          business, technology, and customer. I led a week-long design sprint
          with the stakeholders, addressing how to define a product that
          addresses customers' needs within the various constraints we had.
        %p
          Our goal was to build an MVP in web and iOS platforms to provide the
          services to the customers.

        %h4 The Customer
        %p
          We found that OneBlockâ€™s customers are parents, neighbors, people interested in
          their neighborhoods, and everyone else. They are the customers
          because they want to learn what is going on and also interact with
          the community.
      .row
        %h4 What purpose does Nixle serve to people?
        %p
          In order to define how people would benefit from Nixle, we did an analysis of analogous and competitive products to observe what people got out of these products. These were some of the few we looked at: <a href="http://nextdoor.com/" target="_blank">Nextdoor</a>, <a href="http://patch.com/" target="_blank">Patch.com</a>, and <a href="http://www.potreroview.net/" target="_blank">The Potrero View</a>, amongst others.
        %p
          After this research, we identified the core <a href="https://medium.com/the-job-to-be-done/replacing-the-user-story-with-the-job-story-af7cdee10c27" target="_blank">job</a> of this application that will benefit its customers, whom we defined as "parents, neighbors, people interested in their neighborhoods, and everyone else."

          from completing those goals, and how Nixle could help them accomplish
          them.

              Using <a href="https://www.flinto.com/" target="_blank">Flinto</a>, I created a preliminary prototype of the iOS application. It features the core information architecture in the <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/mobilehig/Bars.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40006556-CH12-SW52" target="_blank">tab bar</a>.
            %p
              One of my biggest learnings was that <strong>I should have built
              lower-fidelity screens for this interactive prototype</strong>,
              perhaps even possibly with pencil and paper. It was too early to
              be thinking about visual design while we were still figuring out
              the information architecture.
            %p
              Furthermore, my teammate who is an iOS developer gave me feedback
              that it's more ideal to test the interactive prototype in
              low-fidelity to assess the complexity of the proposal before
              polishing the "look & feel".

        %h4 Using card sorting to sort out uncertainties
        %p
          During this point in the project, I felt <i>very</i> uncertain about
          the viability of two features: 1) "trackify" and 2) allowing users to
          create alerts. In order to test my hypothesis that these features
          would prove mentally challenging to new application users, I ran a <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/card-sorting" target="_blank">card sorting</a>.
        %p
          This exercise confirmed my hypothesis that these features would be
          mentally complexing to new users, and I was able to defend the
          product decision to not have these two features be in MVP with this
          evidence.

        %p
          In the browser using code, I got to explore different visual and
          communication design for Neon's dashboard. As a team, we liked the
          visual branding of the rightmost image below.

          These iterations above were less ideal, given that the user base
          would primarily be middle-aged woman who frequent Pinterest.
        %p
          When I received branding assets from Nixle's product team, I was able
          to create a lighter interface:

          I found it challenging defining the visual design because I was unsure of the brand. Later into the project, their team handed me their completed branding, which pointed me in the right direction.

      %h4 Shipping
      %p
        In six months, I got to work on shipping a web <strong>and</strong> iOS product for Nixle. It was a challenging but wonderful learning experience going from the initial ideation stage and learning about the company and product, to defining the information architecture, visual design, to creating the design assets necessary in Sketch and Illustrator, to learning about templates and views in Backbone.js on Rails, to touching front-end design in Xcode, and to doing testing and research along the way.
      %p <a href="http://nixle.com">Nixle</a> will be launching this web and iOS application in early November 2014.
