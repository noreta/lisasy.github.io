        %h4 Humble beginnings
        %p
          When I began teaching myself how to use the Adobe Creative Suite in 2011, I found that I didn't know anyone else at my university who was interested in graphic design. As I began to advertise my graphic design work, friends who were in bands and theater shows reached out to me and asked me to make their posters. I became the go-to graphic designer. 
        %p
          When I met Carlos Sanchez, we realized that we could develop a design community where we could learn from one another and work on real projects with our peers at our university.

        %h4 Defining a process
        %p
          I guess I wasn't the only one who wanted to live in San Francisco.
          What began as an innocuous desire to move to the city of my dreams
          emerged a rocky relationship between myself and the city, where I
          questioned my position as a "tech worker" amidst a housing crisis and
          an ever-growing inequality gap amongst residents of the Bay Area.
        %p
          In wanting to belong to the city in a more participatory nature
          beyond simply paying rent, I wanted to be in the public, deliberately
          blending into the street as I drew it.

      %h4 Lessons from leadership
      %p
        When I travelled abroad by myself in April 2014 and visited the one of
        the most sought-after cities in the world, Paris, I wondered about the
        significance of visiting famous sites. After we see the thing we've
        been meaning to see, what's next? I took a few selfies with the Eiffel
        Tower and the Louvre. But yet, I still didn't have a relationship with
        this Place. I did what felt most uncomfortable to me; I tried to draw
        the moment to cement the memory with my ink lines.
