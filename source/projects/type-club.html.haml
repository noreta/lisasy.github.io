        %h4 Humble beginnings
        %p
          When I first learned how to do graphic design in 2011, I discovered the absence of a design community at Wesleyan. I relied on many online resources to improve my skills as a designer, but I realized that if I wanted to make my skills worthwhile to have, I needed to apply them to real projects. After making flyers and websites for school organizations I was apart of, I wanted to find people who shared my interest in design so that we can help each other improve and use our design skills towards benefiting our local community.

        %h4 Defining a process
        %p
          After months of iterating on the best way to organize the team and workflow, we decided that TypeClub would be organized like this:
        %ul
          %li Keep a small team of all designers and one project manager.
          %li Meet weekly in person.
          %li Projects would be assigned to 1-3 designers at a time, keeping everyone involved.
          %li Be led as a cooperative with everyone having an input in the direction of the organization.

      %h4 Lessons from leadership
      %p
        When I travelled abroad by myself in April 2014 and visited the one of
        the most sought-after cities in the world, Paris, I wondered about the
        significance of visiting famous sites. After we see the thing we've
        been meaning to see, what's next? I took a few selfies with the Eiffel
        Tower and the Louvre. But yet, I still didn't have a relationship with
        this Place. I did what felt most uncomfortable to me; I tried to draw
        the moment to cement the memory with my ink lines.
