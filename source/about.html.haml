      My name is Lisa Sy. I am a designer and artist based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am a product designer at <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>. Previously, I was a product designer at <a href="http://thoughtbot.com" target="_blank">thoughtbot</a> in San Francisco.

    %p At thoughtbot, I organized a product design talk series called <a href="http://thoughtbot.com/taco-tuesdays">Taco Tuesdays</a>. I've provided mentorship to designers and engineers assisting them in building their careers.
    %p I graduated from Wesleyan University with an <a href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/amst/">American Studies</a> degree, concentrating in Race and Ethnic Studies. At Wesleyan, I co-founded and ran a student-run design and branding consultancy called <a href="http://lisasy.com/projects/type-club">TypeClub</a>.
