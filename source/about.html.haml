        My name is Lisa Sy. I am a designer and artis based in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am a product designer at <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a>.

    %p I'm passionate about empowering people to understand each other and themselves in compassionate and honest ways. I design products and create art towards this mission.
    %p Previously, I was a product designer at <a href="http://thoughtbot.com" target="_blank">thoughtbot</a> in San Francisco. At thoughtbot, I organized a product design talk series called <a href="http://thoughtbot.com/taco-tuesdays">Taco Tuesdays</a>. I've provided mentorship to designers and engineers assisting them in building their careers.
    %p I graduated from Wesleyan University with an <a href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/amst/">American Studies</a> degree, concentrating in Race and Ethnic Studies. At Wesleyan, I co-founded and ran a student-run design and branding consultancy called <a href="http://lisasy.com/projects/type-club">TypeClub</a>.
    %p I'm proud to call Oakland, California my home. There, I serve as a Design Advisor for <a href="http://odalc.org/" target="_blank">Oakland Digital</a> since October 2015. I've also been a Designer Mentor for <a href="http://www.qeyno.com/" target="_blank">Qeyno Lab</a>'s <a href="http://www.mbkhack.com/" target="_blank">My Brother's Keeper Hackathon</a> in February 2015. When I'm not designing, you can find me pursuing my <a href="http://instagram/lisasyart" target="_blank">art practice</a>, going to music shows, enjoying the sunshine at Lake Merritt, writing, practicing Cantonese and French, and learning about the world and people through stories.
