      My name is Lisa Sy. I am a designer and artist based in California. I was
      born and raised in Los Angeles, went to <a href="http://wesleyan.edu" target="_blank">college</a> in the east coast, and now
      I live in the Bay Area. I work at <a href="http://facebook.com">Facebook</a> as a Product Designer. Previously, I was a product designer at <a href="http://thoughtbot.com" target="_blank">thoughtbot</a> in San Francisco.

    %p At thoughtbot, I organized a product design talk series called <a href="http://thoughtbot.com/taco-tuesdays">Taco Tuesdays</a>. I've provided mentorship to designers and engineers assisting them in building their careers.
    %p I graduated from Wesleyan University with an <a href="http://www.wesleyan.edu/amst/">American Studies</a> degree, concentrating in Race and Ethnic Studies. At Wesleyan, I co-founded and ran a student-run design and branding consultancy called <a href="http://lisasy.com/projects/type-club">TypeClub</a>.
